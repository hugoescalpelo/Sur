Change seeker

Need a sequence that knows a change has been made
The sensor goes in two values: 0 & 800

Data cases are shown below

Non detecting		Detecting		Trascient

Case A	Case B		Case A	Case B		Case A	Case B
0	800		0	800		0	800
0	800		0	800		0	800
0	800		0	800		0	800
0	800		0	800		0	800
0	800		0	800		800	0
0	800		0	800		800	0
0	800		800	0		800	0
0	800		800	0		800	0
0	800		800	0		0	800
0	800		800	0		0	800
0	800		800	0		0	800
0	800		800	0		0	800

So I need a sequence that identifies every chase, thus, the direction
of the disc is expressed in the type of value that remains in non
detecting case.

I think a not-delayed 100 ms array filler woud do the thing

A single number code woud fit the needs

0: Non detecting Case A, left direction
1: Non detecting Case B, right direction
2: Detecting Case A, left direction
3: Detecting Case B, right direction
4: Trascient Case A, left direction
5: Trascient Case B, right direction

Also, user must provide calibration data:

DETECT_THRESHOLD = 800; //The nuber who diferentiate detect from non detect
SENSOR_WINDOW_TIME = 100000; //A number in microseconds that sets the time between readings (100 ms)
TRASCIENT_TIME = 800000; //A number in microseconds that sets the time that defines a trascient (800ms)
