 * Ivan Abreu Studio.

 * 
 * This code controls a set of 3 stepper motors, 2 of them are
 * used to turn the head of the system host, the last one to
 * turn the needle of a big compass.
 * 
 * The target of this pieces is force the host to always see
 * to south and express it with a big model of a compass.
 * 
 * Changelog:
 * V0.1 First development
 *
